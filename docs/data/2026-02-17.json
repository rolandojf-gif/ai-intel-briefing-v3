We present Blueprint, a layout-aware multimodal retrieval system designed for large-scale engineering repositories. Blueprint detects canonical drawing regions, applies region-restricted VLM-based OCR, normalizes identifiers (e.g., DWG, part, facility), and fuses lexical and dense retrieval with a lightweight region-level reranker. Deployed on ~770k unlabeled files, it automatically produces structured metadata suitable for cross-facility search. We evaluate Blueprint on a 5k-file benchmark with 350 expert-curated queries using pooled, graded (0/1/2) relevance judgments. Blueprint delivers a 10.1% absolute gain in Success@3 and an 18.9% relative improvement in nDCG@3 over the strongest vision-language baseline}, consistently outperforming across vision, text, and multimodal intents. Oracle ablations reveal substantial headroom under perfect region detection and OCR.

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.13213v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Commercial insurance underwriting is a labor-intensive process that requires manual review of extensive documentation to assess risk and determine policy pricing. While AI offers substantial efficiency improvements, existing solutions lack comprehensive reasoning capabilities and internal mechanisms to ensure reliability within regulated, high-stakes environments. Full automation remains impractical and inadvisable in scenarios where human judgment and accountability are critical. This study presents a decision-negative, human-in-the-loop agentic system that incorporates an adversarial self-critique mechanism as a bounded safety architecture for regulated underwriting workflows. Within this system, a critic agent challenges the primary agent's conclusions prior to submitting recommendations to human reviewers. This internal system of checks and balances addresses a critical gap in AI safety for regulated workflows. Additionally, the research develops a formal taxonomy of failure modes to characterize potential errors by decision-negative agents. This taxonomy provides a structured framework for risk identification and risk management in high-stakes applications. Experimental evaluation using 500 expert-validated underwriting cases demonstrates that the adversarial critique mechanism reduces AI hallucination rates from 11.3% to 3.8% and increases decision accuracy from 92% to 96%. At the same time, the framework enforces strict human authority over all binding decisions by design. These findings indicate that adversarial self-critique supports safer AI deployment in regulated domains and offers a model for responsible integration where human oversight is indispensable.",

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.13214v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive environments requiring strategic decision-making, yet systematic evaluation of these capabilities remains challenging. Existing benchmarks for LLMs primarily assess static reasoning through isolated tasks and fail to capture dynamic strategic abilities. Recent game-based evaluations employ LLM-vs-LLM tournaments that produce relative rankings dependent on transient model pools, incurring quadratic computational costs and lacking stable performance anchors for longitudinal tracking. The central challenge is establishing a scalable evaluation framework that measures LLM strategic reasoning against consistent, interpretable standards rather than volatile peer models. Here we show that anchoring LLM evaluation to fixed hierarchies of skill-calibrated game Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables linear-time absolute skill measurement with stable cross-temporal interpretability. Built on the Botzone platform's established competitive infrastructure, our BotzoneBench evaluates LLMs across eight diverse games spanning deterministic perfect-information board games to stochastic imperfect-information card games. Through systematic assessment of 177,047 state-action pairs from five flagship models, we reveal significant performance disparities and identify distinct strategic behaviors, with top-performing models achieving proficiency comparable to mid-to-high-tier specialized game AI in multiple domains. This anchored evaluation paradigm generalizes beyond games to any domain with well-defined skill hierarchies, establishing a scalable and reusable framework for assessing interactive AI capabilities.",
