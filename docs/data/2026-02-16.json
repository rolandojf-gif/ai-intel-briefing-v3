      "summary": "arXiv:2602.12305v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Generating high-performance CUDA kernels remains challenging due to the need to navigate a combinatorial space of low-level transformations under noisy and expensive hardware feedback. Although large language models can synthesize functionally correct CUDA code, achieving competitive performance requires systematic exploration and verification of optimization choices. We present OptiML, an end-to-end framework that maps either natural-language intent or input CUDA code to performance-optimized CUDA kernels by formulating kernel optimization as search under verification. OptiML consists of two decoupled stages. When the input is natural language, a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator (OptiML-G) acts as a proposal policy over kernel implementation strategies, producing an initial executable program. A search-based optimizer (OptiML-X) then refines either synthesized or user-provided kernels using Monte Carlo Tree Search over LLM-driven edits, guided by a hardware-aware reward derived from profiler feedback. Each candidate transformation is compiled, verified, and profiled with Nsight Compute, and evaluated by a composite objective that combines runtime with hardware bottleneck proxies and guardrails against regressions. We evaluate OptiML in both synthesis-and-optimize and optimization-only settings on a diverse suite of CUDA kernels. Results show that OptiML consistently discovers verified performance improvements over strong LLM baselines and produces interpretable optimization trajectories grounded in profiler evidence.",

We introduce GT-HarmBench, a benchmark of 2,009 high-stakes scenarios spanning game-theoretic structures such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, Stag Hunt and Chicken. Scenarios are drawn from realistic AI risk contexts in the MIT AI Risk Repository. Across 15 frontier models, agents choose socially beneficial actions in only 62% of cases, frequently leading to harmful outcomes. We measure sensitivity to game-theoretic prompt framing and ordering, and analyze reasoning patterns driving failures. We further show that game-theoretic interventions improve socially beneficial outcomes by up to 18%. Our results highlight substantial reliability gaps and provide a broad standardized testbed for studying alignment in multi-agent environments.

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.12356v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Benchmarking has long served as a foundational practice in machine learning and, increasingly, in modern AI systems such as large language models, where shared tasks, metrics, and leaderboards offer a common basis for measuring progress and comparing approaches. As AI systems are deployed in more varied and consequential settings, though, there is growing value in complementing these established practices with a more holistic conceptualization of what evaluation should represent. Of note, recognizing the sociotechnical contexts in which these systems operate invites an opportunity for a deeper view of how multiple stakeholders and their unique priorities might inform what we consider meaningful or desirable model behavior. This paper introduces a theoretical framework that reconceptualizes benchmarking as a multilayer, adaptive network linking evaluation metrics, model components, and stakeholder groups through weighted interactions. Using conjoint-derived utilities and a human-in-the-loop update rule, we formalize how human tradeoffs can be embedded into benchmark structure and how benchmarks can evolve dynamically while preserving stability and interpretability. The resulting formulation generalizes classical leaderboards as a special case and provides a foundation for building evaluation protocols that are more context aware, resulting in new robust tools for analyzing the structural properties of benchmarks, which opens a path toward more accountable and human-aligned evaluation.",
